    <!--  Javascript Basic statements

       (1) var	Declares a variable
       (2) let	Declares a block variable
       (3) const	Declares a block constant
       (4) if	Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
       (5) switch	Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
       (6) for	Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
       (7) function	Declares a function
       (8) return	Exits a function
       (9) try	Implements error handling to a block of statements

       A variable will have the value undefined after the execution of this statement:
       The let was introduced in 2015 -> ES6
       Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.

       As a general rule, always declare a variable with const unless you know that the value will change.

       the const does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

       Javascript types are dynamic
       -> that means that the same variable can hold different data types

       Float does not exist in Javascript all numbers are decimals

       const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
       -> in this exemple the object " person " has 4 propreties
       in Javascript a variable without value has the undefied value
