    <h2>Try and Catch errors in JavaScript</h2>
    <p>This is typically how to use catch and try -> <span id="try_one"></span></p>
    <!-- Try and catch stuff-->
    <h3>Try and catch utilisation exemple</h3>
    <p>Please enter a value between 6 and 60 :</p>
    <input type="text" id="rolling">
    <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Validate number</button>
    <p id="errors"></p>
    <h2>The <i>This</i> keyword in JavaScript</h2>
    <p>In this exemple, <b>this</b> represents the <b>person</b> object</p>
    <p id="o"></p>
    <h2>Let's talk about <b>arrow</b> in JavaScript now</h2>
    <p id="arrow"></p>
    <h2>Now Let's use a <b>class</b> in JavaScript</h2>
    <p id="clas"></p>


<script>

    class Car 
    {
        constructor(name, brand, year)
        {
            this.name = name;
            this.brand = brand;
            this.year = year
        }

        age()
        {
            let date = new Date();
            return date.getFullYear() - this.year;
        }
    }

    let tkbCar = new Car("Model 3", "Tesla", 2019);

    document.getElementById("clas").innerHTML = "my car is " + tkbCar.age() + " years old";



    /* arrow */
    var hello;
    var salut;

    hello = function()
    {
        return "hello";
    }

    salut = () =>
    {
        return "salut";
    }

    document.getElementById("arrow").innerHTML = salut();

    /* object with this */
    const person =
    {
        firstName: "Christopher",
        lastName: "Tkb",
        netWorth: "400 000 000 $",
        fullName: function()
        {
            return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
        }
    };

    document.getElementById("o").innerHTML = person.fullName();

/* this */

/* first try and catch test */

try

    allert("salut les amis");
}

catch(err)
{
    document.getElementById("try_one").innerHTML = err.message;
}


function myFunction()
{
    const erros = document.getElementById("errors");
    errors.innerHTML = "";
    let rolling = document.getElementById("rolling").value;

    try
    {
        if (rolling == "") throw "is empty";
        if (isNaN(rolling)) throw "is not a number";
            rolling = Number(rolling);
        if (rolling > 60) throw "is too high";
        if (rolling < 6) throw "is too low";

    <!-- 
        (a) JavaScript stores numbers as 64 bits floating point numbers,
            but all bitwise operations are performed on 32 bits binary numbers.
            JavaScript only uses 32 bits Bitwise Operands

        (b) A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

        (c) The try statement lets you test a block of code for errors.
            The catch statement lets you handle the error.
            The throw statement lets you create custom errors.
            The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.

        (d) An EvalError indicates an error in the eval() function.
            A RangeError is thrown if you use a number that is outside the range of legal values.

        (e) JavaScript has 3 types of scope:
            Block scope
            Function scope
            Global scope

        (f) In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables.
            In a web browser, global variables are deleted when you close the browser window (or tab).
            In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
            Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized. 
            JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.

        (g) The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.
            In a method, this refers to the owner object.
            Alone, this refers to the global object.
            In a function, this refers to the global object.
            In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
            In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.


        (e) A JavaScript class is not an object.
            It is a template for JavaScript objects.

        (f) JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.
            JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.
            JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation

        (g) Avoid global variables, avoid new, avoid ==, avoid eval()
            JavaScript objects, variables, properties, and methods can be undefined.
            Empty JavaScript objects can have the value null.
