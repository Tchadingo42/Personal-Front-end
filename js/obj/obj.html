        (a) In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.
            Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
            Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
            Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
            Dates are always objects
            Maths are always objects
            Regular expressions are always objects
            Arrays are always objects
            Functions are always objects
            Objects are always objects
